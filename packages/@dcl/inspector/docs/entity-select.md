## General notes & definitions

For every composite the Editor maintains a set of selected entities.

*Subtree* of an entity is a set comprised of entity itself and all its descendants.

*Transform subset* is a subset of an entity set which includes only entities endowed with Transform component.

*Root subset* is a subset of an entity set such that: subtrees of *root subset* entities do not intersect and cover all entities of a set. In the example below `(S2, S4)` is a *root subset* of selected set `(S2, S4, S4)`.

```
E1 -> S2 -> S3 -> E4
 |
 ---> S4
```

## Visuals in composite inspector

Rows of selected entities should be highlighted.

## Visuals in composite renderer & interaction with Transform tools

Visual representation of selected set in composite renderer is limited to its *Transform subset*.

When *Transform subset* has one entity: show gizmo anchored to local (0, 0, 0) of that entity.

When *Transform subset* has multiple entities:

* Translation tool: show gizmo anchored to geometric mean of local (0, 0, 0) of entities that belong to a *root subset* of *Transform subset*. Apply relative translation of gizmo to those entities. Gizmo is world-axes aligned.

* Rotation tool: show gizmo anchored to geometric mean of local (0, 0, 0) of entities that belong to a *root subset* of *Transform subset*. Rotate those entities about gizmo's axes (not local world-aligned axes). Gizmo is world-axes aligned.

* Scaling tool: show gizmo anchored to geometric mean of local (0, 0, 0) of entities that belong to a *root subset* of *Transform subset*. Apply relative scaling of gizmo to those entities.

## Visuals in entity inspector

If exactly one entity is selected, show its components, otherwise, show nothing.

## Operations

* `Left-click` on an entity in either composite inspector or renderer clears a selected set and then adds a target entity to it. Supports undo/redo.

* `Ctrl + left-click` on an entity in either composite inspector or renderer adds an entity to a selected set if it is not in already, and removes it from selected set otherwise. Supports undo/redo.

* Select subtree: a context menu option. Clears selected set and adds all entities that belong to target entity's subtree to selected set. Supports undo/redo.

* Invert selection: a context menu option. Every selected entity in a currently selected composite becomes unselected, every unselected entity becomes selected. Supports undo/redo.
