# This file provides the default configurations for sdk-commands

# Several .dcl.rc configuration files are loaded for each session, each key of the file
# overrides the previously loaded, and finally it uses env vars if present. Meaning:
# - multiple keys can be present in the same file
# - the last file overrides the first file
# - env vars override the config files entirely
