# @dcl/playground-assets

Assets package for the [Decentraland Playground](https://playground.decentraland.org/).

## Overview

This package contains the built assets required by the Decentraland Playground - an experimental web IDE that allows developers to:

- Write and preview Decentraland scenes in real-time
- Share code snippets with other developers
- Test and iterate on scene code directly in the browser
- View changes instantly in the integrated Decentraland web explorer

Similar to [Babylon.js Playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/), the Decentraland Playground provides an interactive environment for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

## Development

The assets in this package are automatically built during the monorepo's build process:

```bash
# From the root of the monorepo
make build
```
